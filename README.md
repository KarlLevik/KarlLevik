### Hi there, I'm Karl.

I'm a database engineer at Diamond Light Source. I usually work with technologies such as MariaDB, Galera, SQL, Python, bash, Linux and am currently trying to learn Kubernetes. Previously, I've also worked with things like Oracle databases, Java, and some other programming languages.
