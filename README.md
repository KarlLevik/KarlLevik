### Hi there, I'm Karl.

I'm a database engineer at Diamond Light Source. I'm a MariaDB certified DBA, have worked 14+ years with databases and related software development & operations in a Linux environment. I usually work with technologies such as MariaDB, Galera, SQL, Python, bash, Linux and am currently trying to learn Kubernetes. Previously, I've also worked with things like Oracle databases, Java, and some other programming languages.

I also have a PG Dip. (distinction) in structural molecular biology, although that is a while ago and I've not been able to put that knowledge to good use since - except when developing database schemas within that domain.
