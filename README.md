### About me

Hi there, I'm Karl, a database engineer at Diamond Light Source, and a MariaDB certified DBA. I've worked with databases and related software development & operations in a Linux environment since 2006. Technologies such as: MariaDB, Galera, SQL, Python, bash, Linux are ones I know well. In the past I've also worked with Oracle databases, Java, and other programming languages.

I also have a PG Dip. (distinction!) in structural molecular biology which has not been put to good use, except when designing database schemas in that discipline.
