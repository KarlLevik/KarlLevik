### Hi there, I'm Karl.

I'm a database engineer at Diamond Light Source. I'm a MariaDB certified DBA and have worked with databases and related software development & operations in a Linux environment since 2006. Technologies such as MariaDB, Galera, SQL, Python, bash, Linux are ones I know well. In the past I've also worked with Oracle databases, Java, and other programming languages.

I also have a PG Dip. (distinction!) in structural molecular biology, although that is a while ago now, and I've not done any work in that area since, except designing database schemas!
